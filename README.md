# Coding Challenge (Oct 2022)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get started, install the dependencies and fire up the app:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

At this point, the app should be running in development mode and any local modifications you make will be automatically
detected and result in the app to reload.

This boilerplate project is based on TypeScript. If you are not using TypeScript, change .tsx extension to .jsx.
